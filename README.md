- This is a 'fork' of the Jira Work Log Report Chrome extension. 
- Modified to support current Calendar Quarter reporting.
- The change adds the Quarter option in the timeframe dropdown and also displays the total in hours instead of days, hours minutes only.

## Installation
To add to chrome:
- go to Extensions, make sure Developer Mode is enabled
- Load Unpacked and choose the root dir of this repo
- Invoke the extension and add your Jira url. Authentication is done via cookie, so make sure you can access Jira in the same browser profile

## Updating the extension
### If you cloned the repo
Pull changes and then go to extensions and reload extension
### If you downloaded zip
Re-download and overwrite then go to extensions and reload extension
